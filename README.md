In a client-server system, the client application sends requests to a server application through a network connection. In such system, the user interface is implemented in the client and the database is stored in the server. You are required to implement a client-server application to process banking transactions such as withdrawals and deposits. In modern banking systems, a costumer accesses a bank account using an access card at an ATM, at the counter or on the web.
